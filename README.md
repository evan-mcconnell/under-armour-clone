### Description
A clone of the Under Armor website using the Angular framework and sass for styling.

### Learning Objective
To practice using Angular and to get used to using components to plan and style a UI.


### Product Requirements
* The clone site must look and function the same way as the original site.
* Angular implemented with the MVC model (where C = component)
* Data is passed down to child components
* Actions are passed up to parent components

## Planning
Below is the core plan for the project. Each box represents a component. Components may be repeated multiple times, as necessary.
